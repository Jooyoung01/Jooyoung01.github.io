I'm currently studying in a Master's program in Spatial Data Science at <a href='https://www.usc.edu' target='_blank'>University of Southern California</a>.
<h3>Let's understand more about me!</h3>
My ultimate goal is to utilize technology to create a positive and long-lasting impact on society, with a specific focus on enhancing mental health outcomes and resolving societal challenges.

My contemplation on solving social issues begins in the art gallery. Artworks, which I see as the starting points for defining, expressing, and addressing societal problems, encapsulate humanity.
Art pieces depict our past, present, and future, and we hope to be happy. 

During my undergraduate studies, I co-founded a nonprofit organization called 'Korean Vocabulary List' where we explored alternative methods of language expression. I collaborated with designers and writers to create content.
Starting with robotics(Computer Vision) is my approach to addressing social issues, given my science background. The appeal of robotics lies in the requirement for cooperation across different fields. Although I concentrated on computer vision and path planning, it was crucial to collaborate with mechanical, electrical, and design specialists. As someone who enjoys the camaraderie of others and takes pleasure in teamwork, I hope to apply my abilities to address and solve societal concerns.

I am passionate about using cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems. My focus areas include `computer vision, GeoAI, deep learning, and data mining.`

My programming journey began with `C (thanks to Dennis Ritchie)`, and I used Java mainly for Android development. I used Matlab for signal processing projects involving audio and images. When working on robotics projects, I utilized c with ROS (Robot OS), which familiarized me with Linux systems. 
In these days, I mainly use `Python` because of its rapid ðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨ implementation capabilities in various research contexts. I am also comfortable with `R` because it is frequently used in social science research, particularly for network studies. Understanding web technologies is essential for performing diverse social science research and visualizing reports, so I've been learning JavaScript along with node.js.
My favorite library is OpenCV, and in social science research, I often use the R-Siena package for longitudinal network analysis.
