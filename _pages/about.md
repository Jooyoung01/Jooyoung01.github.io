I'm currently studying in a Master's program in *Spatial Data Science* at <a href='https://www.usc.edu' target='_blank'>University of Southern California</a>.
<h3>Let's understand more about me!</h3>
My ultimate goal is to leverage technology to make a positive, lasting impact on society, focusing on mental health and societal challenges. During my undergrad, I co-founded the nonprofit ‘Korean Vocabulary List’ to explore new language expression methods.

With a science background, I started with robotics and computer vision to address social issues, drawn by the collaboration required across fields like mechanics, electronics, and design. I’m passionate about solving complex problems using cutting-edge technologies in `computer vision`, `spatial science`, `deep learning`, and `data mining`. Given this background, I'm very interested in embeddings for spatial intelligence that integrate computer vision, spatial science, and deep learning.🌴🏡

<p><small> My programming journey began with `C (thanks to Dennis Ritchie)`, followed by Java for Android development and Matlab for signal processing. Working with robotics, I used C with ROS(Robot OS), which introduced me to Linux. Now, I primarily use Python for its rapid implementation, and I often turn to R for network studies in social science. I’m also learning JavaScript and Node.js to better visualize research outcomes. My favorite libraries include OpenCV for computer vision and R-Siena for longitudinal network analysis in social science😄.<small><p>
