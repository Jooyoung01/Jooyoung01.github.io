## About Me

I am a **PhD student in Computer Science at Emory University**  
(<a href="https://computerscience.emory.edu/graduate-phd/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science PhD Program</a>),  
advised by <a href="https://www.joonseok.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Joon-Seok Kim</a>.

My research focuses on ``Simulation, Spatial Computing, and Computer Vision``, and I work on topics involving **generative agents**, **geospatial data**, **spatiotemporal representations**, and **foundation models**.

I aim to better understand how people and cities behave across space and time by developing computational approaches grounded in AI, spatial data, and visual information. Before beginning my PhD, I worked across robotics, computer vision, and spatial data science—experiences that shaped my interest in connecting human behavior, environments, and large-scale data.

I am broadly interested in building data-driven systems for urban understanding, complex environment analysis, and next-generation AI simulations.
