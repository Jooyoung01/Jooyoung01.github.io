    title: Road Damage Detection (ORDDC'2024)
    description: The Optimized Road Damage Detection Challenge 2024 (ORDDC'2024) is a competitive project aimed at developing advanced machine learning models to detect and classify road damages accurately and efficiently. The challenge involves utilizing a large dataset of over 40,000 road images to improve model performance, accuracy, and processing speed.
    tool: YOLO, Ensemble Learning, Multi-processing
